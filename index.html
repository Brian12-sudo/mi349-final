<p>My name is Brian Huber, I am a college student attending Michigan State University.
    going into my senior year, I am majoring in media and information with a concentration
    in information management and design for society. In terms of career path, I do not
    have a specific career in mind, but with a college degree my options are sure to be 
    plentiful going into the future. </p>

<div><img src="game-logo.png" alt="logo-controller" id="controller" class="box"></div>
<p>When it comes to hobbies and extracurriculars, sports only stuck with me up until 
    high school. Once I left sports, my favorite hobbies or activities became gaming and fishing. 
    However, I took more interest in the gaming hobby than fishing compared to one of my other family members. 
    Some of my favorite games include the Call of Duty series, Destiny 2, and Battlefield 1 that I play on my 
    PlayStation 4 console. My interests, for the most part, in gaming is what led to my general interest in
    media information technology and media related topics.</p>



<h2 id="personal" class="h2-heading">Family</h2>

<div><img src="family-icon.png" alt="family-icon" id="family" class="box"></div>
<p>I come from a family of five including myself, living in Northville Michigan. I was 
    born in Charlotte, North Carolina along with my identical twin, Mathew. Although 
    we are identical and thus born on the same day, I am considered the youngest by only five minutes. 
    On the other end of the sibling spectrum, my brother Thomas is the oldest. Last but not least, 
    my parents, that go by the name of Nancy and Tom or mom and dad. </p>

<h2 id="vacation" class="h2-heading">Vacation</h2>

<div></div>

<p>My family, including myself, have carried on a long lived and cherished tradition 
    of returning to the same vacation spot once every year. That vacation spot being 
    Ocean City, Maryland along with renting a one to two week-stay at the Pyramid condominium 
    complex. This location has a wide variety of activities that can take place on the beach, 
    boardwalk, or ocean. In short, this spot makes for great fun and cherished memories for 
    anyone lucky enough to visit.</p>
