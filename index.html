<p>My name is Brian Huber, I am a college student attending Michigan State University.
    going into my senior year, I am majoring in media and information with a concentration
    in information management and design for society. In terms of career path, I do not
    have a specific career in mind, but with a college degree my options are sure to be 
    plentiful going into the future. </p>
